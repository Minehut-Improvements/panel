# Our take on the Minehut Panel
This frontend runs on Minehut's Dev servers. You must make a new account there if you don't already have one. You cannot use your production ("normal") minehut account. If you do not know what this means, just follow the login steps, but make an account first.

Frontend is in the `views/` folder.

The API middleware is in the `index.js` file. This middleware handles authentication, proxying API requests, and the websocket connection for the console.
