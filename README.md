# Login extension

This is extension that redirects minehut's login request to our panel. It does not redirect your credentials, just the session token.

### Disclaimer:

The addon will be disabled when you restart your firefox. So you will have to reinstall it every time you restart firefox.

### Installing the extension:
1. Download the [extension](https://github.com/Minehut-Improvements/panel/raw/refs/heads/extension-firefox/Minehut_Improved-Firefox-Port.zip) zip file.
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click on `Load Temporary Add-on`

5. Congratulations, you have installed it. Please continue to log in to the panel.
You can view and edit the source code of the extension in the extension's zip file. The extension is extremely simple, so there shouldnt really be any need to edit it. However, if you do, just make your edits directly to the zip file and click the reload button on the extension's card.
